# MLP_Autoencoder
An MLP autoencoder for face feature extraction and classification. Images are preprocessed and reconstructed through a dense encoder–decoder network. The encoder’s latent vectors are used as features for an SVM tuned with GridSearchCV. The project reports reconstruction accuracy and recognition performance with visual plots.
